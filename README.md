# Flutter Scalable OCR

Forked from https://github.com/vbalagovic/flutter_scalable_ocr

`v1.0.1`

Flutter scalable OCR package is a wrapper around [Google ML kit Text Recognition](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_text_recognition). It tackles the issue of fetching data just from part od a camera and also narowing down the camera viewport which was common problem. To see how it work in real case scenario you can check the app where it was used [Exchange Rate Scanner](https://www.erscanner.com/) and here are some gifs from example project.

## Requirements

Since thus package uses [ML Kit](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_commons) check [requirements](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin#requirements) before running the package in project.

## Features

Scan text from narow window of camera and not whole screen. There are two function `getScannedText` to fetch readed text as a string, or `getRawData` which returns list of `TextElement` consult [ML Kit Text Recognition](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition) objects as from followin structure from google developer site image. Pinch and zoom should also work:

Note: Wrapper uses [Camera](https://pub.dev/packages/camera) package so you need to add perimission as in documentation.
